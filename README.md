The first thing you have to do is:
- Go into the flex_config file
- input your desired PATHs!
- RENAME "flex_config" to "config"
- Save!
- (in the future the Key Management has to be also done by some, as of March 2024 the given codes work)
- It is important to create the .JSON-file and the .csv-File MANUALLY. (Simply open up editor, enter something, and then save as the desired file. The content will be dealt with automatically. EXCEPT FOR THE CONFIG FILES!)

Execute from the "main.py" method!

Your Interpreter should import all of the packages necessary that are given in the import statements!

Template for the config-file:

{
"API-Key": "Any_key",
"API-Insttoken": "Any_Insttoken",
"Paths": {
	      "filepath": "C:\\Users\\your_name\\something\\something.JSON",
        "output_path": "C:\\Users\\your_name\\something\\something2.JSON",
        "output_file_path": "C:\\Users\\your_name\\something\\something.csv"
    }
}
